# PySchool/Problem Solving in Python
* This is a collection of open source materials originally used to assist high school teachers with bringing
* the python programming language into the classroom. It was developed so that it could be used for either distance
* learning or as in-classroom material and contains step by step explinations of the theorhetical and practical 
* principles one might need to begin their programming journey. Many of the examples it includes are based on principles
* from physics and chemistry in order to reinforce those scientific concepts and show how programming can be used to 
* solve real problems.
